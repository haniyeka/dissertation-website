\section{Sub-Portfolio Selection Based on $p_{\cap}$}
Based on the discussion in Chapter Four, the optimal values of $p_{\cap}$ for IPC2018, MAXSAT19-UCMS, SAT11-INDU, SAT18-EXP, and SAT16-MAIN are 0.59, 0.55, 0.63, 0.81, and 0.33, respectively for regression random-forest performance model. In the following, some examples of the prediction distribution curves are plotted per scenario.
Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_ipc2018} shows two instances from the IPC2018 scenario, \textit{nurikabe\_p03.pddl} (left) and \textit{caldera\_p03.pddl} (right). Since the optimal value of $p_{\cap}$ for this scenario is 0.59, for each instance we choose the solvers whose overlap area with the minimum predicted solver is greater than 0.59. Based on this method, for \textit{nurikabe\_p03.pddl}, \textit{blind}, \textit{Delfi1}, \textit{FDMS2}, \textit{symbolic.bidirectional}, and \textit{DecStar} will be chosen to run in parallel, while \textit{blind} is the VBS and also the best predicted solver. For the \textit{caldera\_p03.pddl} instance, two solvers are selected: \textit{Metis1} and \textit{Metis2}. In this instance, the Virtual Best Solver (VBS) is also the blind solver, but the solver with the minimum predicted time is \textit{Metis1}.

The same situation exists with the MAXSAT19-UCMS scenario, where the optimal $p_{\cap}$ is 0.55. Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_maxsat} shows that based on the optimal $p_{\cap}$ for the \textit{wolfram72\_9.wcnf} instance (left), the \textit{UWrMaxSat.1.0}, \textit{maxino2018} and \textit{MaxHS} solvers should be selected. For this instance, \textit{UWrMaxSat.1.0} is the best predicted solver, and \textit{MaxHS}, which is included in the portfolio, is the actual best solver. For the \textit{1bpi\_2knt\_gwcnft.wcnf} instance (right), all solvers except \textit{MaxHS} are selected in the portfolio, and the VBS (Virtual Best Solver) \textit{QMaxSAT2018} is included in the subportfolio. The same situation exists with the SAT scenarios; however, due to the large number of solvers in those scenarios, the plots are omitted here.
